        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Mauro. I'm currently studying Computer Science at California State University, San Bernardino, and Information Systems at College of the Desert. My passion for technology began when I started experimenting with code, and it's grown into a fascination with cybersecurity, software development, and everything in between.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m bilingual and speak both Spanish and English fluently. My interests span across coding in Python (with recent forays into C++ and C#), working with electronics like Raspberry Pi's and Arduino, and competing in cybersecurity Capture the Flag events.
        </p>
        <p>
            By day, I work as an Information Systems Apprentice and Desktop Technician at Eisenhower Health, ensuring everything runs smoothly and learning along the way. Outside of work, I’m often doing schoolwork, playing video games, coding, building projects, or learning nerdy stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website is where I share my projects, ideas, and things that I come across. Feel free to reach out—I'm always up for collaboration, a chat, or job opportunities.
        </p>
