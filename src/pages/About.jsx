          Hi, I'm <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', textShadow: '0 0 10px rgba(0, 227, 140, 0.5)' }}>Mauro</span>.
          I'm currently studying Computer Science at California State University, San Bernardino, and
          Information Systems at College of the Desert. My passion for technology began when I started
          experimenting with code, and it's grown into a fascination with cybersecurity, software development,
          and everything in between.

          lineHeight: '1.8',
        }}>
          I'm bilingual and speak both <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Spanish and English</span> fluently.
          My interests span across coding in Python (with recent forays into C++ and C#), working with electronics
          like Raspberry Pi's and Arduino, and competing in cybersecurity Capture the Flag events.

          By day, I work as an <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', textShadow: '0 0 10px rgba(0, 227, 140, 0.5)' }}>
          Information Systems Apprentice and Desktop Technician</span> at Eisenhower Health, ensuring everything
          runs smoothly and learning along the way. Outside of work, I'm often doing schoolwork, playing video games,
          coding, building projects, or learning nerdy stuff.
