            Hi, I'm <span className="font-bold" style={{ textShadow: '0 0 10px rgba(0, 227, 140, 0.5)' }}>Mauro</span>.
            I'm currently studying Computer Science at California State University, San Bernardino, and
            Information Systems at College of the Desert. My passion for technology began when I started
            experimenting with code, and it's grown into a fascination with cybersecurity, software development,
            and everything in between.

          <p className="text-xl text-[#00e38c] mb-5 leading-relaxed">
            I'm bilingual and speak both <span className="font-bold">Spanish and English</span> fluently.
            My interests span across coding in Python (with recent forays into C++ and C#), working with electronics
            like Raspberry Pi's and Arduino, and competing in cybersecurity Capture the Flag events.

            By day, I work as an <span className="font-bold" style={{ textShadow: '0 0 10px rgba(0, 227, 140, 0.5)' }}>
            Information Systems Apprentice and Desktop Technician</span> at Eisenhower Health, ensuring everything
            runs smoothly and learning along the way. Outside of work, I'm often doing schoolwork, playing video games,
            coding, building projects, or learning nerdy stuff.
